# TicTacToeGame
TicTacToe game practice on my old Panasonic CF-30

This laptop at the time of creating this has a 2-core processor, and 2GB of DDR2 RAM. It used to have a
windows 7 install on it, but that was abandoned for a more lightweight ubuntu distro, lubuntu. I'm testing 
out the capabilities of this old laptop. This project will show what this old laptop can do!!!!
